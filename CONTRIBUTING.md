Rules
=====

1. Only through Pull Requests can you submit changes or additions to the code
2. Every Pull Request has to be reviewed by two team members
3. New code should be covered 100% by unit tests
4. Code should pass the `pylint` style check
5. Functions, classes, methods should have a `Google-style docstring`.
6. Larger new features should come with an example and narrative documentation.
7. When you're ready for your Pull Request to be reviewed, in the top right corner you can suggest two reviewers,
or alternatively, ping @ilogue or @HeikoSchuett and we will assign reviewers.


HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
==================

1. Commit often (every 10-30 minutes when you're coding)
2. Open a Pull Request for your feature branch as soon as you start on it. This way the team can see your intentions 
and give your feedback early on, avoiding dissapointing news after you've put in a lot of work.
