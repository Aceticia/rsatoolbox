Getting started
===============

The easiest way to install pyrsa is with pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install pyrsa

To use pyrsa:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrsa import xyz
    xyz()

Also make sure your setup meets the requirements to run the toolbox with the relevant toolboxes installed (see requirements.txt). 

As in introduction, we recommend having a look at the Jupyter notebooks in ``demos``.
